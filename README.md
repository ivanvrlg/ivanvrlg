## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm IvÃ¡n

I am a Research Assistant under [Anna Sadnicka](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/13416-anna-sadnicka) at UCL's  [Queen Square Institute of Neurology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/) and [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit). 
We are collaborating with the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/#) based at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) to develop resources for our analysis of movement in clinical patients.

Previously, I worked examining behaviour in animal models of autism and developing postprocessing tools for computational neuroanatomy.
